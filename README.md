# Monetify: Decentralized Subscription Platform for Discord

Monetify is a decentralized platform that allows Discord server owners to monetize their private channels and exclusive content through secure subscription models. With blockchain technology and smart contracts, Monetify ensures transparency, security, and complete control over your server's monetization.



## Appendix: Advanced Configuration

Monetify is a decentralized platform that allows you to monetize your Discord server by accepting subscription payments. If you're setting up Monetify, simply clone the repo, link your wallet, and add the bot to your server. Payments are handled securely via blockchain, ensuring both transparency and safety for creators and subscribers.

If you run into issues, make sure your wallet is correctly linked and has sufficient funds. If the bot isn’t responding, check its permissions and make sure it's running without errors. For payment issues, be patient, as cryptocurrency transactions can sometimes take longer depending on the network.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or encounter problems—contributions and improvements are always welcome!
